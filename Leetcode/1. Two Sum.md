To solve the **Two Sum** problem in an interview, you should start with the most basic approach and gradually optimize it. Here's how you can explain it step by step:

---

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

#### 1. **Brute Force Approach (Naive solution)**:
- **Explanation**:  
  The most straightforward approach is to check every pair of elements in the array to see if their sum equals the target. We loop through each element and for each element, we loop again through the remaining elements to find a pair that adds up to the target.

- **Implementation**:
    ```python
    class Solution:
        def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
            n = len(nums)
            for i in range(n):
                for j in range(i + 1, n):
                    if nums[i] + nums[j] == target:
                        return [i, j]
    ```

- **Time Complexity**: O(n²) because we check every possible pair of elements.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) since we are not using any additional space.
  
- **Interview Explanation**:  
  This approach works by comparing each element with every other element, but it’s inefficient for large arrays. We can improve the solution by avoiding the repeated comparisons.

#### 2. **Sorting with Two Pointers Approach**:
- **Explanation**:  
  One improvement is to first sort the array and use a two-pointer technique to find the pair that adds up to the target. However, the challenge with this method is that sorting the array would change the indices, so we would need to store the original indices before sorting.

- **Steps**:
  1. Store the indices of each element before sorting.
  2. Use two pointers, one starting at the beginning and the other at the end of the sorted array.
  3. Move the pointers inward until you find a pair that sums to the target.
  
- **Implementation** (But note that sorting alters original indices):
    ```python
    class Solution:
        def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
            nums_with_index = [(num, i) for i, num in enumerate(nums)]
            nums_with_index.sort()  # Sort by values, keep original indices
            left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
            while left < right:
                current_sum = nums_with_index[left][0] + nums_with_index[right][0]
                if current_sum == target:
                    return [nums_with_index[left][1], nums_with_index[right][1]]
                elif current_sum < target:
                    left += 1
                else:
                    right -= 1
    ```

- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) due to sorting.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) because we are using an additional list to store the indices.

- **Interview Explanation**:  
  While this is an improvement over brute force, it still involves sorting, which is O(n log n). We can solve this problem in linear time, which leads us to the optimal solution.

#### 3. **HashMap (Dictionary) Approach (Optimized Solution)**:
- **Explanation**:  
  The optimal solution can be achieved using a **hashmap** (or a Python dictionary). As we iterate through the array, we store each element's complement (i.e., `target - nums[i]`) in the hashmap. For each element, we check if its complement is already in the hashmap, meaning we’ve already encountered the other number required to make the target sum.

- **Steps**:
  1. Traverse the array.
  2. For each element, calculate its complement (the number needed to reach the target).
  3. Check if the complement is already in the hashmap.
  4. If found, return the current index and the index of the complement.
  5. Otherwise, store the current element in the hashmap.

- **Implementation**:
    ```python
    class Solution:
        def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
            num_map = {}  # Dictionary to store number and its index
            for i, num in enumerate(nums):
                complement = target - num  # Calculate the complement
                if complement in num_map:
                    return [num_map[complement], i]  # Return indices of complement and current number
                num_map[num] = i  # Store the current number with its index
    ```

- **Time Complexity**: O(n) because we traverse the array once and lookups in a hashmap are O(1) on average.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) because we store up to `n` elements in the hashmap.

- **Interview Explanation**:  
  This approach leverages the power of a hashmap to reduce the time complexity to O(n). For each number, we compute its complement and check if it’s already in the hashmap. If it is, we return the two indices; if not, we store the number and continue. This is the most efficient solution to the problem.

### Interview Summary:

- Start by discussing the **brute force approach** (O(n²)) to demonstrate a basic understanding of the problem.
- Then, discuss the **two-pointer approach** after sorting (O(n log n)) to show you are thinking of optimizations but highlight the sorting drawback.
- Finally, present the **hashmap approach** (O(n)), which is the optimal solution. This approach uses a dictionary to track the indices of numbers and find the solution in one pass.

This step-by-step explanation shows the interviewer that you can reason through multiple levels of optimization and ultimately arrive at the best solution.
