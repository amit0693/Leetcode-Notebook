For **Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II**, you can approach this problem similarly to the previous ones but with a key difference: here, you can complete as many transactions as you like (buy and sell multiple times) as long as you’re not holding more than one stock at a time. Let’s go step by step to optimize the solution, similar to how you might explain it in an interview.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

#### 1. **Brute Force Approach (Naive Solution)**:
- **Explanation**:  
  The most straightforward approach is to check every possible pair of days (i.e., every combination of buying and selling) and calculate the total profit. The goal is to maximize the total profit by considering every possible combination of transactions.

- **Implementation**:
    ```python
    class Solution:
        def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
            maxProfit = 0
            for i in range(len(prices)):
                for j in range(i + 1, len(prices)):
                    if prices[j] > prices[i]:
                        maxProfit = max(maxProfit, prices[j] - prices[i])
            return maxProfit
    ```

- **Time Complexity**: O(n²) because you compare each pair of prices.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1).

- **Interview Explanation**:  
  This approach checks all possible buy-sell pairs, but it’s very inefficient. We need a way to optimize this solution since we are allowed to make multiple transactions.

#### 2. **Optimized Approach: Greedy Algorithm**:
- **Explanation**:  
  Instead of checking every possible combination, you can take advantage of every "upward" trend. The problem allows multiple transactions, so for every price increase (i.e., when the price on day `i` is lower than the price on day `i+1`), you should buy and sell to capture the profit. The key observation is that it’s beneficial to add up all these small profits (the difference between consecutive days where the price increases) because they lead to the maximum possible profit.

- **Steps**:
  1. Traverse the array of prices.
  2. If today's price is less than tomorrow's price (i.e., there's a potential profit), add the difference to the total profit.
  3. Continue this for the entire array to capture all upward trends.

- **Implementation**:
    ```python
    class Solution:
        def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
            maxProfit = 0
            for i in range(1, len(prices)):
                if prices[i] > prices[i - 1]:  # If today's price is higher than yesterday's
                    maxProfit += prices[i] - prices[i - 1]  # Add the difference (profit) to maxProfit
            return maxProfit
    ```

- **Time Complexity**: O(n) because we are iterating through the array just once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) as we only use a few variables to track profit.

- **Interview Explanation**:  
  This approach optimizes the problem by focusing on the fact that we need to capture every profitable opportunity. We add up all the small profits from every consecutive day where the price goes up. This leads to an O(n) solution, which is the most efficient for this problem since we are allowed to perform multiple transactions.

### Interview Summary:

- Start by discussing the **brute force approach** (O(n²)) where you check every possible buy-sell combination. However, explain that this approach is inefficient.
- Then, present the **greedy approach** (O(n)), where you simply take advantage of every increase in price by buying and selling each time. This way, you maximize the profit by capturing all the small gains in the array.
- Finally, explain why this greedy approach works for this problem, since the key is to maximize profit from multiple transactions.

By walking through these steps, you show a clear progression in your thinking, from a naive solution to an optimal one, which is what interviewers appreciate.
