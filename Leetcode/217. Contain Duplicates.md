### Step-by-Step Explanation:

#### 1. **Brute Force Approach (Naive solution)**:
- **Explanation**:  
  The simplest way to solve this problem is to compare each element with every other element in the array. If any two elements are equal, return `true`; otherwise, return `false`.
  
- **Implementation**:
    ```python
    class Solution:
        def containsDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
            n = len(nums)
            for i in range(n):
                for j in range(i + 1, n):
                    if nums[i] == nums[j]:
                        return True
            return False
    ```

- **Time Complexity**: O(n²) because for every element, we check every other element.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) as we are not using any extra space.

- **Interview Explanation**:  
  This approach is inefficient because it requires checking every pair of elements, which becomes slow as the array size grows. It’s important to find a faster solution.

#### 2. **Sorting Approach**:
- **Explanation**:  
  A better approach would be to sort the array first. After sorting, if there are any duplicates, they will appear next to each other. So, we can simply iterate through the sorted array and check if any consecutive elements are the same.

- **Implementation**:
    ```python
    class Solution:
        def containsDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
            nums.sort()  # Sort the array
            for i in range(1, len(nums)):
                if nums[i] == nums[i - 1]:
                    return True
            return False
    ```

- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) due to sorting.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) if sorting in place; O(n) if using an external sorting algorithm.

- **Interview Explanation**:  
  Sorting improves the time complexity to O(n log n), which is much faster than O(n²), but it still requires sorting the entire array. This might not be ideal if we’re looking for a truly optimal solution.

#### 3. **HashSet Approach (Optimized Solution)**:
- **Explanation**:  
  The most efficient approach is to use a hash-based data structure, like a `set`. The `set` will store unique elements as we iterate through the array. If we encounter an element that is already in the `set`, it means there’s a duplicate, and we can return `true`. If we finish iterating without finding any duplicates, return `false`.

- **Implementation**:
    ```python
    class Solution:
        def containsDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
            seen = set()  # Create an empty set to track seen elements
            for num in nums:
                if num in seen:  # If num is already in the set, it's a duplicate
                    return True
                seen.add(num)  # Add num to the set
            return False  # No duplicates found
    ```

- **Time Complexity**: O(n) because we only loop through the array once, and both adding to a `set` and checking membership in a `set` are O(1) operations on average.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) because we use a `set` to store the elements we’ve seen.

- **Interview Explanation**:  
  This approach is optimal because it only requires one pass through the array and uses a `set` to track elements, which gives us O(n) time complexity. The `set` allows us to efficiently check for duplicates while keeping space usage to O(n).

### Interview Summary:

- Start by explaining the **brute force approach** (O(n²)) to show your thought process and understanding of the problem.
- Then, explain the **sorting approach** (O(n log n)) as an improvement but highlight that sorting might not be necessary.
- Finally, present the **optimized solution using a set** (O(n)) to demonstrate your ability to solve the problem efficiently.
  
This approach shows the interviewer that you can think through different levels of optimization and arrive at the best solution.
