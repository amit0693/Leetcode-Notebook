For the **Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock** problem, we can approach it similarly by starting with a simple brute force solution and then optimizing it step by step. Here’s how you can explain your approach in an interview:

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

#### 1. **Brute Force Approach (Naive Solution)**:
- **Explanation**:  
  The most straightforward approach is to calculate the profit for every possible pair of days. For each day, try to buy the stock and then check all future days to calculate the profit by selling it. Return the maximum profit encountered.

- **Implementation**:
    ```python
    class Solution:
        def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
            maxProfit = 0
            n = len(prices)
            for i in range(n):
                for j in range(i + 1, n):
                    profit = prices[j] - prices[i]
                    maxProfit = max(maxProfit, profit)
            return maxProfit
    ```

- **Time Complexity**: O(n²) because we compare each pair of prices.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) as we are only using a variable to track the maximum profit.

- **Interview Explanation**:  
  This approach checks all possible pairs of buy and sell days, but it’s inefficient with a time complexity of O(n²). We can improve this solution by avoiding the need to check every pair.

#### 2. **Optimized Approach using a Single Pass (Kadane's Algorithm Approach)**:
- **Explanation**:  
  Instead of checking every pair, we can track the minimum price encountered so far as we iterate through the array. At each step, we calculate the potential profit if we sell at the current price and compare it to the maximum profit we've seen so far.

- **Steps**:
  1. Initialize `minPrice` to a large value (infinity).
  2. Iterate through the prices:
     - If the current price is lower than `minPrice`, update `minPrice`.
     - Otherwise, calculate the profit if we sell at the current price (current price - `minPrice`).
     - Keep track of the maximum profit encountered.

- **Implementation**:
    ```python
    class Solution:
        def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
            minPrice = float('inf')  # Initialize with a very large value
            maxProfit = 0  # Initialize maxProfit to 0

            for price in prices:
                if price < minPrice:
                    minPrice = price  # Update the minimum price so far
                else:
                    maxProfit = max(maxProfit, price - minPrice)  # Calculate the profit and update maxProfit

            return maxProfit
    ```

- **Time Complexity**: O(n) because we only traverse the list once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) since we are only using two variables (`minPrice` and `maxProfit`).

- **Interview Explanation**:  
  This approach optimizes the solution to O(n) by only traversing the list once. We track the minimum price as we go and calculate the potential profit for each day, updating the maximum profit whenever we find a better one. This approach is efficient and uses constant space.

### Interview Summary:

- Start with the **brute force approach** (O(n²)) to demonstrate the most basic way of solving the problem.
- Explain that the brute force solution is inefficient and can be optimized by keeping track of the minimum price seen so far and calculating the potential profit on each day.
- Present the **optimized solution** using a single pass (O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity), which is the most efficient solution to this problem.

By walking through these approaches, you show your ability to improve a solution iteratively, leading to the optimal approach.
